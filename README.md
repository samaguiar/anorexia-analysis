# anorexia-analysis
## Overview ##
This project focuses on constructing data visualizations, point estimates, and confidence intervals using R. 

## The Questions ##
1. Did treatment "f" help participants gain weight?
2. How can we calculate the confidence interval of the before and after weights of the participants?

## Data Source ##
The data set was obtained from https://stat4ds.rwth-aachen.de/data/. Originally, the data set classified the participants into three categories: "c", "cb", and "f". The data set was cleaned to only look at the 17 families that received treatment from Anorexia data, which were classifed as "f".

## Requirements ##
R and R studio were used to create data visualization and confidence intervals. No additional packages are needed.

## Features Included ##
1) Creating Histograms for the before and after weights to analyze skew and visualize changes in weight.
2) Calculated point estimates, like mean and standard deviation, for the before and after weights in the sample.
3) Determine the confidence intervals for the before and after weights in the sample.

## Next Steps ##
[] Compare the "f" treatment to "c" and "cb" to determine which treatment had a better success rate.
[] Create additional visualizations (i.e. box plot, violin blot, etc.)
